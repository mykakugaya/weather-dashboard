Weather Dashboard: 
This weather application allows users to search the weather outlook for multiple cities to make their travel plans accordingly. It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery, with a responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes. 
The user-friendly application utilizes data retrieved from OpenWeather API to present the current weather conditions and 5-day forecast information for any city the user inputs. The provided result includes data on weather aspects such as temperature, humidity, wind-speed, and UV-index. 
Search history is saved for convenience, allowing users to access the weather of all previously searched cities. The last searched city information appears when the weather dashboard is opened, and users have the option to clear all past searches if desired.
